# Marketing-DataAnalytics
Conducted thorough data cleaning: handled missing values, removed extreme outliers from the Income column, and calculated customer Age from YearBirth for further segmentation. 

Identified high-spending customer segments through boxplots, scatterplots, and linear regression plots for income and purchase-related metrics. 

Created clear visual insights using Seaborn heatmaps and pairwise correlation matrices to understand relationships between numerical variables. 

Built multiple subplot visualizations to compare purchase types (Web, Catalog, Store, Deals) across income levels, education, and age groups.
